# CSC365 - Project 3

## Task 1
Covert the VAERSDataNov15_21.csv dataset into a transaction dataset , VAERSData_ML where each row contains the following information: VAERS_ID,VAX_MANU, RECVDATE, AGE_YRS, SEX, DIED, DATEDIED,VAX_DATE,  no_of_symptoms(k), symptom_1, symptom_2, ..., symptom_k

## Task 2 - Association Rule Mining
Design and implement an algorithm to discover “association rules” on the VAERSData_ML dataset. You may try out different algorithms. Visualize the result you found. Report any interesting association rules discovered in the experiments and explain why they are interesting.

## Task 3 - Project Report
The report needs to contain:
### Theoretical Discussion:
Limited to two pages discussing about data preprocessing steps, the motivation for selecting a particular method, and how the parameters are chosen.
### Results:
Include results of your experimentations.
### Discussion and error analysis:
Try to interpret the results of your model. Discuss intuitions or hypothesis that can be obtained by visual inspections of the resulting association rules. Mention about assumptions if any, discuss issues that might have affected the model’s performance.
